# literacycouncil

Beaverton Literacy Council has been providing free ESL and citizenship classes to parents of Beaverton School District for several decades. It has been my pleasure to work with them to give their website a complete overhaul. I am completely redesigning and rebuilding the site as well as rewriting the copy. 

This website is currently a work in progress and has been built using Zurb Foundation.
