# Beaverton Literacy Council Website

Beaverton Literacy Council has been providing free ESL and citizenship classes to parents of Beaverton School District for several decades. It has been my pleasure to work with them to give their website a complete overhaul. I am completely redesigning and rebuilding the site as well as rewriting the copy. 

This website is currently a work in progress and uses a responsive Foundation grid and jQuery UI. The BLC website is used primary by grade school children who are translating into another language for their parents, who are seeking information about classes. With this in mind, the goal of the site is to present crucial information as clearly and concisely as possible.
